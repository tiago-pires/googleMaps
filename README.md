## How about the API Key?

Considering that key has to be included in the `<script>` tags of your HTML pages, to load the JS files/data from google's servers, there is nothing you can do:

* you must put it in your HTML files
* every one can take a look at those.

Still, it doesn't really matter : if anyone tries to use this key on another domain than yours, they will get a Javascript alert -- which is not nice for ther users. There is nothing you can do, this is the way it works, and there is not much you should worry about, I'd say. [stack overflow](https://tinyurl.com/y8ssbbsl)
